# Sentence predicetion website
## Description:
This is a project to deploy a machine learning model on an interative website. We decide to use twitter's topic and author controlled dataset to train a language model based on Roberta as the pre-trained part. After training, we will deploy on the cloud computing platform. And then, using flask to communicate with the front-end and get user's input to compute the probabilities of distribution. Finally, fetch the result back to the front-end.
